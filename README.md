## Release

## Beta

The beta version of the app will automatically build on new commits to the main branch. Beta builds are available via Firebase App Distribution.

## Play Store

Play Store releases are handled by the GitHub Action called "Deploy Production."

To create a new release, first add a changelog for the next version by running `make changelog`:

```
Added changelog for next build (1009)
./fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs/1009.txt
```

Edit file with a description of the important changes made since the last release and commit.  On commit, add the `[skip ci]` GitHub tag to the commit message to avoid
rebuilding a beta version of the app that has not changed.
